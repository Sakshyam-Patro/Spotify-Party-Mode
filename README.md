## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+
- Spotify Premium account (for playback features)
- Spotify Developer App ([Create here](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard))

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Sakshyam-Patro/Spotify-Party-Mode.git
cd Spotify-Party-Mode

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the application
npm start

# Open http://127.0.0.1:3001 in your browser
```

### Environment Setup

#### 🔧 Spotify App Configuration

**Important:** Spotify has new redirect URI requirements (April 2025). Follow these steps:

1. **In your [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard):**
   - Use `http://127.0.0.1:3001/auth/spotify/callback` (not localhost)
   - For production/demos, use HTTPS URLs only

2. **Create `.env` file:**

```env
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_spotify_client_id
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_spotify_client_secret
SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI=http://127.0.0.1:3001/auth/spotify/callback
PORT=3001
```

#### 🌐 Multi-Device Testing & Demos

For sharing with others or testing across devices:

```bash
# Install ngrok for secure public access
npm install -g ngrok

# In a separate terminal, create secure tunnel
ngrok http 3001

# Copy the HTTPS URL (e.g., https://abc123.ngrok.app)
# Update both:
# 1. Your .env file:
SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI=https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok.app/auth/spotify/callback

# 2. Your Spotify app settings in the developer dashboard
```

**✅ Spotify Requirements:**
- ✅ Use `127.0.0.1` instead of `localhost` for local development
- ✅ Use HTTPS for production/sharing (ngrok provides this)
- ✅ Exact URI match between .env and Spotify dashboard
